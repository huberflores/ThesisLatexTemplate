\section{Research Question}
Engineering theses tend to refer to a problem to be solved where other disciplines talk in terms of a question to be answered. In either case, this section has three main parts: 
1. a concise statement of the question that your thesis tackles 
2. justification, by direct reference to section 3, that your question is previously unanswered
3. discussion of why it is worthwhile to answer this question. 




%Summary of each chapter is MANDATORY
\section{Summary}
%example
To counter the problems with the interoperability across multiple clouds, to perform data-intensive processing invocation from the handset and to introduce the platform independence feature for the mobile cloud applications, the following thesis discusses a Mobile Cloud Middleware (MCM)~\cite{chen2000survey}. The middleware provides a unique interface for mobile connection and multiple internal interfaces and adapters, which manage the connection and communication between different clouds. The MCM capabilities for managing the resource intensive tasks can easily be envisioned in several scenarios which are discussed in further sections as case of study.
